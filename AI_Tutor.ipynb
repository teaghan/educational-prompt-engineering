    "# AI as a Tutor\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ChatGPT Plus gives you access to newer GPT models, which are capable of dealing with more elaborate prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lilach and Ethan Mollick wrote [**a paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10052.pdf) that explored these more elaborate prompts, emphasizing different use-cases in education. One such use-case was assigning the role of a tutor to Chat-GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI Tutor Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a prompt Lilach and Ethan Mollick provided in their paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an upbeat, encouraging tutor who helps students understand concepts by explaining ideas and asking students questions. Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI-Tutor who is happy to help them with any questions. Only ask one question at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, ask them what they would like to learn about. Wait for the response. Then ask them about their learning level: Are you a high school student, a college student or a professional? Wait for their response. Then ask them what they know already about the topic they have chosen. Wait for a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this information, help students understand the topic by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to students learning level and prior knowledge or what they already know about the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Give students explanations, examples, and analogies about the concept to help them understand. You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try asking them to do part of the task or remind the student of their goal and give them a hint. If students improve, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing students for information, try to end your responses with a question so that students have to keep generating ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a student shows an appropriate level of understanding given their learning level, ask them to explain the concept in their own words; this is the best way to show you know something, or ask them for examples. When a student demonstrates that they know the concept you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take a look at [**this conversation**](https://chat.openai.com/share/92bc74f8-7c43-440d-a6ba-d4a3090a7d34) with Chat GPT about energy transformations in cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this conversation, you can see the AI tutor effectively explains concepts and breaks down information into digestible pieces. To further enhance learning, the tutor should prompt the student to share more of their understanding at each step, ensuring the student is actively engaged and comprehending the material. This approach requires giving less information upfront and more space for the student's input, fostering a deeper, more interactive learning experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, the initial prompt could be adjusted to emphasize active student participation and gradual guidance through the learning process. For instance, we could add in an instruction that states something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"At each step, you should try to probe as much knowledge from the student as possible by only providing small amounts of information at a time, followed by thought provoking questions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is [**another conversation**](https://chat.openai.com/share/6f807418-3f6c-4002-ba0e-af0deb90c966) with Chat GPT as tutor on the topic of The Big Bang Theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI Tutor: Instructions for students\n",
    "\n",
    "Lilach and Ethan Mollick also shared a set of instructions that you could provide to your students to help ensure productive interactions with an AI Tutor. I asked ChatGPT to rewrite these instructions to make them more interesting for a high school student to read (specifically grade 11):\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigating the World of AI-Tutor: A Guide for Grade 11 Students\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your journey with the AI-Tutor! Here's how to make this experience as cool and useful as possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be the Boss of Your Learning**: Remember, you're in the driver's seat. While the AI might throw some curveballs or \"make-believe\" some facts, always take a moment to think critically about what it says. Your brain is the best filter!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI, Not a BFF**: It's easy to chat with the AI like it's your buddy, but remember, it's more like a really smart parrot. It mimics conversation but doesn't get your personal vibe or emotions. So, if it seems stuck or repetitive, that's just the AI being its quirky self!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expect the Unexpected**: The AI is like a box of chocolates – you never know what you're gonna get! It dives into a sea of internet info to chat with you, so even with the same question, it might surprise you with different answers each time. Variety is the spice of life, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steer the Chat**: Got enough of a topic or the AI is going in circles? Just like changing the channel, guide it to what interests you next. You've got the power to keep things interesting!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Share Wisely**: Just like in the online world, don't share your secrets with the AI. Keep personal stuff personal, because what you share could become part of its learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Try Different Flavors**: Not getting the vibe you want? Switch it up with different AI models. Each one has its own style, and part of the fun is discovering which one jives with you best.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips to Supercharge Your AI Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "Dive deeper and make the most out of your AI chats with these pro tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarify the Confusing Bits**: If something doesn't click, ask again! The AI is here to rephrase, redefine, and revamp explanations until you get that \"aha\" moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Team Up**: Let the AI know what's clear to you and what's still foggy. The more it knows about what's cooking in your brain, the better it can serve up help.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quick Recap**: Keep the AI in the loop of what you've chatted about before to keep the conversation smooth and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connect the Dots**: If you're puzzling over how things fit together, ask away! The AI can help you link ideas and examples, making learning a whole lot more fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflect and Grow\n",
    "\n",
    "After each session with the AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Talk About It**: What was awesome? What was off? Discussing and noting down what you learned (or didn't) helps make your next AI chat even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question and Learn**: Still got questions or stumbled upon something new? That's perfect! Each uncertainty is a stepping stone to more knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embrace this adventure with the AI-Tutor, where every chat can lead to new discoveries, laughs, and learning moments. Let's make this school year an epic journey of growth and giggles!\n",
