    "# Iterative Prompt Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it's for a one-time use or as part of a template for repetitive tasks, developing effective prompts for ChatGPT is often an iterative process. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Visualize Your Ideal Response\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a task in mind for ChatGPT to assist with, visualize what an ideal response would look like. What type of content would it include? How is it formatted? What's the length?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visualize this response, ask yourself if there are specific details regarding the [key components of a good prompt](https://github.com/teaghan/educational-prompt-engineering/blob/main/key_components.ipynb) that are relevant to this response. These components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Task (always relevant)\n",
    "2. Context (usually relevant)\n",
    "3. Exemplars (can be very helpful)\n",
    "4. Persona (nice-to-have)\n",
    "5. Format (can be very helpful)\n",
    "6. Tone (nice-to-have)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Provide an Initial Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Try your best to provide a prompt that includes a task and some of the other key components. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be specific from the beginning; putting more thought into a good initial prompt can make the iterative process of developing a good prompt much more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good formula to help get you started is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "First sentence: General Context with Persona (if needed)\n",
    "Second sentence: More Specific Context \n",
    "Third sentence: Task \n",
    "Additonal info: Exemplar/Format/Tone (if needed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Analyze the Response\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your initial prompt, produce a response from ChatGPT and identify any issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there something missing from the response? \n",
    "- Is the format correct?\n",
    "- Does the response match the intent of the prompt?\n",
    "- Does the response maintain a consistent tone and style throughout the generated text?\n",
    "- Does the response form a logical and coherent narrative?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Refine your Prompt \n",
    "\n",
    "*Directly* address the issues you found by modifying your prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you need a better example? \n",
    "- Is more specific context necessary?\n",
    "- Can constraints like length or tone be added?\n",
    "- Can you use more specific wording that can help ChatGPT generate text that is more accurate and relevant?\n",
    "- Can the prompt be structured more coherently?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** If you feel like you are being specific enough, yet you continually find that the responses are not making the correct associations, sometimes rephrasing the prompt is all it takes to align the response with the intended outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat steps 2-4 until the response meets your desired criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a Template\n",
    "\n",
    "As educators, we've got a bunch of regular tasks on our plate, and we're always finding nifty systems to make things run smoother. Some of these tasks can likely be made much more efficient if we develop the right type of prompt. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sending weekly staff announcement emails\n",
    "- Providing report card comments\n",
    "- Developing math word problems or class discussion questions \n",
    "\n",
    "For these types of tasks, it could be ideal to have a generalizable prompt template that we can utilize time and time again.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a challenge, identify a task that is repetative and time-consuming, but necessary. Use the iterative prompt development process outlined above to create an refine a prompt to help with that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Try storing these prompts within your workflow to minimize the number of clicks that it takes to get you to that final output. This may seem like overkill, but it emphasizes the importance of efficiency when using a tool like ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, the example below concludes with the creation of a template.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of the Iterative Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say I want to develop a report card comment for a student. For illustrative purposes, I'm going to start with a relatively poor prompt:\n",

    "        Strengths:\n",
    "        Taylor consistently exhibits positive classroom behavior, creating a conducive learning environment for peers. They actively contribute to class discussions, showcasing a strong grasp of the material. Taylor effectively communicates understanding through verbal interactions, fostering a collaborative and engaging atmosphere in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Areas for Improvement:\n",
    "        While Taylor excels in verbal expression, there is room for improvement in articulating their understanding through written work. Encouraging Taylor to transfer their insightful thoughts and knowledge to written assignments will further enhance their overall communication skills. Additionally, Taylor tends to distract others during independent work time, impacting the focused learning environment. Addressing this behavior will contribute to a more productive and focused classroom setting. Lastly, Taylor could benefit from refining their time management skills to ensure the optimal use of class time for both individual and group tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Overall, Taylor has shown positive engagement and understanding in the classroom, and with targeted improvements in written expression, minimizing distractions, and effective time management, they have the potential to further excel academically.\n",

    "        Taylor has shown positive classroom behavior throughout the semester, consistently contributing to class discussions and demonstrating a strong understanding of historical concepts through verbal communication. However, there is room for improvement in articulating their understanding through written assignments. While their oral contributions are insightful, translating these thoughts into written work requires more attention. Additionally, Taylor occasionally distracts others during independent work time, impacting the overall focus of the class. Encouraging them to be mindful of their peers' concentration will contribute to a more productive learning environment. Lastly, optimizing the use of class time is an area that Taylor can work on. Focusing on tasks efficiently and minimizing distractions will enhance their overall academic performance. With continued effort and attention to these areas, Taylor has the potential to further excel in History 11.\n",
