    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "You are a teacher with a passion for fostering open dialogue and critical thinking in your grade 10 social studies class. Your class just finished a unit on Globalization and its impact. Create three discussion questions that will encourage students to reflect on economic, cultural, and environmental aspects. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reflecting on the interconnectedness of global economies, discuss how advancements in technology and communication might contribute to the interconnectedness of global economies. Use specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format your three questions as a numbered list.\n",

    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Considering the cultural dimension of globalization, explore how the exchange of ideas, values, and traditions has been influenced by global interconnectedness. Provide examples of cultural interactions that have both positive and negative impacts, and discuss the implications for local cultures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Investigate the environmental consequences of globalization by examining how the movement of goods, resources, and technologies on a global scale affects ecosystems and natural resources. Discuss specific instances where globalization has led to environmental challenges or innovations, and analyze the role of international cooperation in addressing these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Delve into the economic disparities that can arise from globalization, particularly in relation to income inequality and access to resources. Explore how global economic interconnectedness may contribute to both economic growth and inequality within and between countries. Provide examples and discuss potential strategies for mitigating these disparities while still fostering economic growth on a global scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide follow-up prompts to ChatGPT and the model will use the chat history to help determine its next response. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Question 1: Cultural Dimension**\n",
    "   - *Specificity (4):* The question is quite specific in asking about the cultural dimension of globalization, but it could be more focused on particular aspects of culture.\n",
    "   - *Coherence (5):* The question is well-structured and clear in its focus on cultural interactions, providing a framework for discussion.\n",
    "   - *Relevance (5):* It is highly relevant to the unit on globalization, as it delves into the cultural impacts of global interconnectedness.\n",
    "   - *Stimulating (4):* While it encourages thoughtful reflection, it could be more stimulating by providing more context or examples to prompt deeper thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Question 2: Environmental Consequences**\n",
    "   - *Specificity (5):* The question is highly specific, focusing on the environmental consequences of globalization and requesting examples.\n",
    "   - *Coherence (4):* It is coherent, but a slight improvement could be made by providing more explicit guidance on the analysis of international cooperation.\n",
    "   - *Relevance (5):* The question is highly relevant, connecting the environmental aspect to the broader theme of globalization.\n",
    "   - *Stimulating (4):* The question is thought-provoking, but providing more context on the potential solutions or challenges could enhance its stimulating nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Question 3: Economic Disparities**\n",
    "   - *Specificity (4):* The question is specific in addressing economic disparities resulting from globalization but could be more explicit in terms of examples.\n",
    "   - *Coherence (5):* The question is well-structured and clear in its focus on economic disparities and potential strategies.\n",
    "   - *Relevance (5):* It is highly relevant to the unit, as it explores economic aspects of globalization.\n",
    "   - *Stimulating (4):* While it encourages critical thinking, providing more concrete examples or scenarios could make it more stimulating.\n",

    "Well, ChatGPT thinks pretty highly of itself!\n",

    "Even though each question received a fairly high rating, it does highlight areas for improvement. Let's see if it can implement these improvements:\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Improving the discussion questions</h4><p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In exploring the cultural dimension of globalization, analyze how the rapid exchange of popular culture, such as music, fashion, and film, impacts local traditions and identities. Provide specific examples of cultural interactions that highlight both positive and negative consequences, and discuss potential ways communities can navigate these changes while preserving their cultural heritage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Investigate the environmental consequences of globalization by examining specific case studies where the movement of goods, resources, and technologies has led to either environmental challenges or innovative solutions. Reflect on the role of international cooperation in addressing these issues, and consider how global initiatives can better balance economic growth with environmental sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Delve into the economic disparities arising from globalization, focusing on income inequality and resource access. Provide concrete examples of countries or communities affected by these disparities and discuss potential strategies for fostering more equitable global economic development. Consider how international cooperation can play a role in mitigating these disparities while promoting sustainable economic growth.\n",
