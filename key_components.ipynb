    "# Key Components of a Good Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafting effective prompts is a nuanced art that goes beyond mere instruction; it's about orchestrating a collection of elements to guide language models like ChatGPT. We will delve into the key components of a good prompt, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A [Task](#1.-Task) (Mandatory)\n",
    "2. [Context](#2.-Context) (Important)\n",
    "3. [Exemplars](#3.-Exemplars) (Important)\n",
    "4. A [Persona](#4.-Persona) (Nice-to-have)\n",
    "5. [Format](#5.-Format) (Nice-to-have)\n",
    "6. [Tone](#6.-Tone) (Nice-to-have)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at examples of each of these components, then combine multiple components to form [complete examples of prompts](#Complete-Examples) that could be used by a teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [another tutorial](), we talk about the internal mechanisms of an Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT and how the above components relate to these mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also provide [a tutorial]() on how to go about crafting prompt templates to make every day tasks more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeff Su also provides some really nice introductory videos on the key components of a good prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Master the Perfect ChatGPT Prompt Formula (in just 8 minutes)!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC4v5AS4RIM)\n",

    "\"Act as an eco-conscious biologist committed to fostering ecological awareness in your grade 12 biology class.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the exact format you want the end results to have, then describe that format to ChatGPT. This will allow you to copy and paste it into your desired destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** When using ChatGPT to proofread, specify that any changes should be bolded.\n",

    "\n",
    "</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can describe the *feeling* you're going for and ask ChatGPT to come up with the tone:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Example</h4><p>\"I want to be taken seriously without coming off as too stuck up. Can you please give me a list of 5 tone keywords that I can include in a prompt for ChatGPT?\"</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complete Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples contain one or two of the key components, but here are some complete examples that contain several components:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Developing a set of physics review problems</h4><p>\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a teacher with 20 years experience who excels at creating questions that provoke thought and discussion in your classroom. Your physics 11 class has just finished the unit on Newton's Laws. Write a set of 4 review questions that you could ask your physics 11 students to ensure that they have grasped the following concepts: (1) the connection between a net force and acceleration (2) the concept of a \"normal force\", (3) friction, and (4) Newton's third law. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A 10 kg box that is initially at rest on a horizontal surface is then pushed with a horizontal force of 20 N. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.25, Will the box move?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ChatGPT:\n",
    "    Certainly! Here are four questions that assess students' understanding of the concepts related to Newton's Laws:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Acceleration and Net Force:\n",
    "       - You apply a constant force of 30 N to a 5 kg object on a frictionless surface. What will be the resulting acceleration of the object?\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Normal Force:\n",
    "       - A book is placed on a table. Describe the relationship between the weight of the book and the normal force exerted by the table on the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Friction:\n",
    "       - A 15 kg box is sliding to the right on a rough surface with a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.3. If a horizontal force of 40 N is applied to the box, what will be the net force and the acceleration of the box?\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Newton's Third Law:\n",
    "       - Explain Newton's third law using an example. How do the forces between two interacting objects relate to each other according to this law?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feel free to adapt these questions based on the specific details you covered in your Newton's Laws unit and the level of understanding you expect from your Physics 11 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Report Card Comment</h4><p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a professional, yet supportive tone to write a report card comment for Taylor who is a student in your History 11 class. The comment should be a single paragraph.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Their strengths are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Positive classroom behaviour\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Contributes to class discussion\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Shows understanding through conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "Their areas for improvement are: \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Articulating their understanding through written work\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Distracting others during independent work time\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Using class time effectively\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ChatGPT:\n",
    "        Taylor has demonstrated positive classroom behavior throughout the semester, consistently contributing to class discussions with insightful and thoughtful contributions. They excel in conveying their understanding of historical concepts through verbal communication. However, there is room for improvement in articulating that understanding through written assignments. During independent work time, Taylor occasionally becomes a source of distraction to their peers, impacting the focused atmosphere of the classroom. Additionally, using class time more effectively would greatly benefit Taylor's academic progress. With continued effort in written expression and a mindful approach to independent work, I am confident that Taylor will reach their full potential in History 11. I appreciate their positive attitude and active participation in class.\n",
