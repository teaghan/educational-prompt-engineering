    "# Key Components of a Good Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeff Su provides some really nice introductory videos on the key components of a good prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Master the Perfect ChatGPT Prompt Formula (in just 8 minutes)!\n",
    "](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC4v5AS4RIM)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Beginner to Pro with ChatGPT in One Video!\n",
    "](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkf3XBOj2PE)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Task (Mandatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "Initiate the task sentence with an **\"Action Verb\"**; you can include multiple tasks within a prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Considerations:\n",
    "- Use action verbs like generate, give, write, analyze, edit to convey the desired task.\n",
    "- Clearly state the intended outcome to guide the model effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Context (Important)\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide the LLM context by **considering the audience**, their background, and the desired success criteria. The context should be limited to what is most relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Considerations:\n",
    "- Define the audience precisely, specifying background details.\n",
    "- Consider the audience's **environment** and what success looks like for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"You are teaching grade 10 math and just completed a unit on linear equations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Including Exemplars (Important)\n",
    "\n",
    "Illustrate the **reasoning process** and **structure** you expect the language model to follow by including exemplars in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Considerations:\n",
    "- Exemplars should demonstrate the desired reasoning and response structure.\n",
    "- Use specific examples that align with the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Persona (Nice-to-have)\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the persona you want ChatGPT to embody. Imagine someone you'd want instant access to for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Considerations:\n",
    "- Specify the desired characteristics and expertise for the persona.\n",
    "- Consider how the persona's traits can enhance the quality of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Act as a teacher with 20 years experience who values the unique learning styles of all students.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Format (Nice-to-have)\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the exact format you want the end results to have, then describe that format to ChatGPT. This will allow you to copy and paste it into your desired destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- a table with headers\n",
    "- a structured lesson with topic headings\n",
    "- paragraphs\n",
    "- markdown formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When using ChatGPT to proofread, specify that any changes should be bolded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Tone (Nice-to-have)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify the desired tone for the response, whether it's \"8th grade English\", a casual/formal voice, witty output, or enthusiasm. Clearly communicate the emotional or tonal aspect you're aiming for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can describe the *feeling* you're going for and ask ChatGPT to come up with the tone:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"I want to be taken seriously without coming off as too stuck up. Can you please give me a list of 5 tone keywords that I can include in a prompt for ChatGPT?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "> Act as a teacher with 20 years experience who values the unique learning styles of all students. Write a set of 6 questions that you could ask students to ensure that they have grasped the following concepts: ..."

    "# Understanding Transformers for Effective Language Model Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformer Architecture Components and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Query/Key/Value (QKV) Mechanism:**\n",
    "At its core, a transformer model operates on the basis of attention, and the QKV mechanism is fundamental to this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query:** Think of the Query as the question being asked. It's like the model's way of saying, \"What should I focus on?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key:** The Key is the content being examined. It's like the model's way of saying, \"What information is available?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value:** The Value is the information associated with the Key. It's like the model's way of saying, \"Here's the relevant data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model attends to a certain word in the input (Key), it is determining how much attention to give to different words in the sequence (Value) based on the current word (Query).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationship to the Components of a Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the QKV mechanism helps in crafting effective language model prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In essence, a well-crafted prompt mirrors the interaction between Queries, Keys, and Values in a transformer, guiding the model to focus on the right information and generate contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Initiating the task with an action verb.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate this to the QKV mechanism: the Query is the task you want the model to perform, the Key is the relevant context, and the Value is the expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Context:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Providing the audience and success criteria.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the transformer, the context (Key) is vital for the model to generate meaningful responses (Values). It's about providing the right information for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Including Exemplars:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Providing exemplars help the model understand the desired reasoning process.* \n",
    "\n",
    "In QKV terms, exemplars are examples that shape the attention of the model, guiding it to focus on specific details (Keys) when generating responses (Values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Persona:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Defining the role for ChatGPT to take-on.* \n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with the Query aspect, instructing the model on how to approach the task based on a predefined personality or role.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Describing the desired format for ChatGPT's response.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It's about structuring the response (Values) in a way that aligns with the intended format outlined in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Tone:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tone guides the style of the response by instructing the model on how to infuse a particular mood or style into its generated content*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is analogous to instructing the model on how to attend to certain details (Query) and present them (Values)."
